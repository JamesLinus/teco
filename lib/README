This is a sample library of a startup environment which makes available
several functions via pre-loaded Q registers.  The Makefile puts these
together into a .tecorc which assembles all these functions in a form
useful during teco startup.  The functions provided are:

	block.tec	QS Block indent functions, useful for C
	book.tec	A book reader (run teco raw, no other functions)
	emacs.tec	QE A mini-emacs macro
	fill.tec	QF Paragraph fill
	repl.tec	QI MH-style reply function
