This directory is a new version of TECO, ported to System V 3.2 by
Andy Valencia.  This is a direct derivative work of the original
author, and is distributed under the same terms as the original.  See
the directory doc.orig/ for more details.

Aside from changes needed to port from a BSD environment to a System V
one, I have fixed a large number of bugs, usually found in the process
of porting TECO macros.  I have also converted the indentation style to
fit in a 80-column window, and left out the ^L's which were originally
entered.  More recently, I have made the source gcc/clang -Wall
friendly.

A number of useful macros are in lib/.

This work is provided as-is without any guarantees, and is
purely the result of my own personal interests.

Good luck!
Andy Valencia
