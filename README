This directory is a new version of TECO, ported to System V 3.2 by
Andy Valencia.  This is a direct derivative work of the original
author, and is distributed under the same terms as the original.  See
the directory doc.orig/ for more details.

Aside from changes needed to port from a BSD environment to a System V
one, I have fixed a large number of bugs, usually found in the process
of porting TECO macros.  I have also converted the indentation style to
fit in a 80-column window, and left out the ^L's which were originally
entered.  If you don't like the coding style, accept my apologies and
flames to /dev/null!

A number of useful macros are in lib/.

This work is provided as-is without any guarantees.  It is the result
of my own personal work, and does not represent the views or interests
of my current employer.

					Good luck!
