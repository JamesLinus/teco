This directory is a new version of TECO, ported to System V 3.2 by
Andy Valencia.  This is a direct derivative work of the original
author, and is distributed under the same terms as the original.  See
the directory doc.orig/ for more details.

The directory doc/ contains a hand-entered copy of an old TECO manual
I always use.  More up-to-date versions of TECO documentation exist,
but I find that this document is shorter, yet provides most of the
things I look for.

Aside from changes needed to port from a BSD environment to a System V
one, I have fixed a large number of bugs, usually found in the process
of porting TECO macros.  I have also converted the indentation style to
fit in a 80-column window, and left out the ^L's which were originally
entered.  If you don't like the coding style, accept my apologies and
flames to /dev/null!

The result of my macro porting is the lib.t.UU file.  To avoid problems
of converting escapes and control characters, I ship my TECO macros
in this format.  Merely uudecode the file, then un-tar it.  It will
create a lib/ subdirectory with individual files, each ready to be
loaded with eilib/foo$$.

This work is provided as-is without any guarantees.  It is the result
of my own personal work, and does not represent the views or interests
of my current employer.

					Good luck!
